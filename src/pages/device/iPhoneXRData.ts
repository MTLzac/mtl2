      <p>The iPhone XR shipped with iOS 12 and received major updates through iOS 18. As of 2026, it does not support iOS 26 and will not receive future major feature updates from Apple.</p>
      <p>Apple has historically provided limited security patches to devices one or two generations behind the current release. However, these patches are not guaranteed and typically address only critical vulnerabilities — they do not include new features or app framework updates.</p>

    whatVersion: {
      heading: "What iOS Version Does the iPhone XR Support?",
      contentHtml: `
        <p>The iPhone XR supports up to <strong>iOS 18</strong>. This was the last major iOS version available for the A12 Bionic chip. The device did not receive iOS 19, iOS 20, or any subsequent releases.</p>
        <p>It's important to understand the difference between <strong>feature updates</strong> and <strong>security updates</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Feature updates</strong> (e.g., iOS 18 → iOS 19) bring new capabilities, app frameworks, and UI changes. The iPhone XR no longer receives these.</li>
          <li><strong>Security updates</strong> are smaller patches that fix vulnerabilities. Apple may still issue these for iOS 18, but on a limited and unpredictable schedule.</li>

  // ── What Happens When Updates Stop ──
  updateDeprecation: {
    heading: "What Happens When the iPhone XR Stops Getting iOS Updates?",
    contentHtml: `
      <p>The iPhone XR does not stop working when it loses iOS support. Calls, messaging, browsing, and most currently installed apps continue to function normally.</p>
      <p>What changes over time is <strong>app compatibility</strong>. App developers build against the latest iOS SDKs, and older versions gradually lose support. This process is gradual — not immediate — but accelerates as the device falls further behind the current iOS release.</p>
      <p>Security is the other consideration. Without regular patches, known vulnerabilities remain unaddressed. For most users, this doesn't create an immediate crisis, but it does increase risk over time — particularly for devices used for banking, payments, or storing sensitive information.</p>
    `,
    appCompatibility: {
      heading: "App Compatibility Issues Canadian Users May Notice",
      contentHtml: `
        <p>From our experience, these are the categories of apps where Canadian users tend to notice compatibility issues first:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Banking apps</strong> — TD, RBC, Scotiabank, and BMO typically require iOS versions within two major releases of the current version. Users on iOS 18 may find these apps stop updating or display compatibility warnings.</li>
          <li><strong>Transit and payment apps</strong> — Presto, city transit apps, and mobile payment platforms often follow similar requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Government services</strong> — CRA My Account, provincial health apps, and digital ID services may require newer iOS versions for security compliance.</li>
          <li><strong>Two-factor authentication apps</strong> — Apps like Microsoft Authenticator and Google Authenticator will eventually require newer OS versions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This doesn't mean these apps stop working overnight. The transition is gradual, and many apps continue to function on older iOS versions even after they stop receiving updates for them.</p>

  // ── Is It Worth Fixing? ──
  worthFixing: {
    heading: "Is the iPhone XR Worth Fixing in 2026?",
    contentHtml: `
      <p>From our experience repairing iPhones daily, whether an iPhone XR is worth fixing depends on the type and extent of the damage. A single-issue repair on an otherwise functional device is often worthwhile. Multiple simultaneous failures typically tip the equation toward replacement.</p>

      heading: "When Repairing an iPhone XR Usually Makes Sense",
      contentHtml: `
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Battery replacement only</strong> — The most cost-effective repair for the XR. Restores daily battery life and removes performance throttling. Typically completed in under an hour.</li>
          <li><strong>Screen replacement only</strong> — If the display is cracked but everything else works (Face ID, cameras, charging), screen repair extends the device's life at a fraction of replacement cost.</li>
          <li><strong>Device otherwise in good condition</strong> — If the XR's software limitations aren't a problem for your use case (e.g., secondary phone, kids' device, basic daily driver), a single repair is usually worthwhile.</li>

          <li><strong>Screen + back glass damage</strong> — Combined repair cost for both panels on the XR often approaches or exceeds the device's market value.</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple major repairs required</strong> — Screen, battery, and charging port failures together make repair uneconomical in most cases.</li>
          <li><strong>Repair cost approaches device value</strong> — As a general guideline, if the total repair estimate exceeds 60–70% of what a comparable replacement costs, upgrading is usually the better investment.</li>

        "iPhone XR with cracked front display glass, a common repair scenario",
      contentHtml: `
        <p>Front glass damage is the most common repair we see on the iPhone XR. The XR uses a single LCD and digitizer assembly, which means the entire front panel is replaced as one unit. This keeps repair straightforward and turnaround fast.</p>
        <p>Aftermarket and OEM-equivalent screen options are available at different price points. Both restore full touch functionality — the main difference is colour accuracy and brightness levels, which most users won't notice in daily use.</p>

        "iPhone XR with cracked back glass, a common repair scenario when evaluating whether the device is worth fixing",
      contentHtml: `
        <p>Back glass repair on the iPhone XR is more involved than screen replacement. Unlike iPhone 12 and later models (which use a removable back panel), the XR's back glass is laser-welded to the aluminium frame. This means the repair requires either a full housing swap or careful glass-only removal.</p>
        <p>The repair is still viable and something we perform regularly, but it costs more than a screen replacement due to the additional labour. For devices with back glass damage only, repair is usually worthwhile. For devices with both front and back glass damage, the combined cost should be weighed against the device's current value.</p>

  // ── Trading In or Upgrading ──
  tradeInUpgrade: {
    heading: "Trading In or Upgrading From an iPhone XR",
    contentHtml: `
      <p>The iPhone XR's trade-in value in 2026 is modest and heavily condition-dependent. Devices in good cosmetic condition with healthy batteries command higher values, while those with cracked screens, battery degradation, or carrier locks trade at significant discounts.</p>
      <p>If you're considering a trade-in, it's worth understanding the difference between <strong>cash trade-ins</strong> and <strong>store credit</strong>. Cash offers are typically lower but provide immediate liquidity. Store credit toward a replacement device is often higher but locks you into a specific retailer or carrier.</p>
      <p>Upgrading is optional and entirely user-led. For users whose daily needs are met by the XR, there's no urgency to upgrade. For those hitting app compatibility walls or needing better camera performance, common upgrade paths include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/devices/iphone-11">iPhone 11</a> — One generation newer, with Night Mode camera and slightly longer software runway</li>
        <li><a href="/devices/iphone-12">iPhone 12</a> — First iPhone with 5G, MagSafe, and OLED display. Significantly longer iOS support window</li>
        <li>Refurbished iPhone 13 or 14 — Strong mid-range value in the used market</li>

      question: "Is the iPhone XR worth fixing?",

        "For single-issue repairs like a worn battery or cracked screen, repair is typically worthwhile if the device meets your software needs.
