    <p>As of 2026, the iPhone XS Max does not support iOS 26 and will not receive future major iOS updates. Released in 2018 as Apple's first large-format OLED iPhone, the XS Max pairs a 6.5-inch Super Retina display with the A12 Bionic chip. While it remains usable for everyday tasks, its end-of-life software status and OLED screen repair costs increasingly favour upgrading when multiple repairs are needed.</p>

  quickTakeawayHtml: `
    <strong>Quick takeaway:</strong> The iPhone XS Max remains a capable large-screen device in 2026, but its lack of iOS 26 support and the cost of OLED screen replacement mean that upgrading is often the better long-term value when multiple repairs are needed. For single issues like battery wear, repair is still cost-effective.

  // ── iOS Support Status ──
  iosSupportStatus: {
    heading: "iPhone XS Max iOS Support Status in 2026",
    contentHtml: `
      <p>The iPhone XS Max shipped with iOS 12 and received major updates through iOS 18. As of 2026, it does not support iOS 26 and will not receive future major feature updates from Apple.</p>
      <p>Apple has historically provided limited security patches to devices one or two generations behind the current release. However, these patches are not guaranteed and address only critical vulnerabilities — they do not include new features or app framework updates.</p>
      <p>The XS Max shares the same A12 Bionic chip as the <a href="/devices/iphone-xs">iPhone XS</a> and <a href="/devices/iphone-xr">iPhone XR</a>, which means all three devices reached their iOS support ceiling at the same time.</p>

      heading: "What iOS Version Does the iPhone XS Max Support?",
      contentHtml: `
        <p>The iPhone XS Max supports up to <strong>iOS 18</strong>. This was the last major iOS version available for the A12 Bionic chip. The device did not receive iOS 19, iOS 20, or any subsequent releases.</p>
        <p>It's important to understand the difference between <strong>feature updates</strong> and <strong>security updates</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Feature updates</strong> (e.g., iOS 18 → iOS 19) bring new capabilities, app frameworks, and UI changes. The iPhone XS Max no longer receives these.</li>
          <li><strong>Security updates</strong> are smaller patches that fix vulnerabilities. Apple may still issue these for iOS 18, but on a limited and unpredictable schedule.</li>

  // ── What Happens When Updates Stop ──
  updateDeprecation: {
    heading: "What Happens When the iPhone XS Max Stops Getting iOS Updates?",
    contentHtml: `
      <p>The iPhone XS Max does not stop working when it loses iOS support. Calls, messaging, browsing, and most currently installed apps continue to function normally.</p>
      <p>What changes over time is <strong>app compatibility</strong>. Developers build against the latest iOS SDKs, and older versions gradually lose support. This process is gradual — not immediate — but accelerates as the device falls further behind the current iOS release.</p>
      <p>Security is the other consideration. Without regular patches, known vulnerabilities remain unaddressed. For most users, this doesn't create an immediate crisis, but it increases risk over time — particularly for devices used for banking, payments, or sensitive information.</p>
    `,
    appCompatibility: {
      heading: "App Compatibility Issues Canadian Users May Notice",
      contentHtml: `
        <p>From our experience, these are the categories of apps where Canadian users on the XS Max tend to notice compatibility issues first:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Banking apps</strong> — TD, RBC, Scotiabank, and BMO typically require iOS versions within two major releases of the current version. Users on iOS 18 may find these apps stop updating or display compatibility warnings.</li>
          <li><strong>Transit and payment apps</strong> — Presto, city transit apps, and mobile payment platforms often follow similar requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Government services</strong> — CRA My Account, provincial health apps, and digital ID services may require newer iOS versions for security compliance.</li>
          <li><strong>Two-factor authentication apps</strong> — Apps like Microsoft Authenticator and Google Authenticator will eventually require newer OS versions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This doesn't mean these apps stop working overnight. The transition is gradual, and many apps continue to function on older iOS versions even after they stop receiving updates for them.</p>

  worthFixing: {
    heading: "Is the iPhone XS Max Worth Fixing in 2026?",
    contentHtml: `
      <p>From our experience repairing iPhones daily, the XS Max occupies a middle ground: its larger battery and screen make it a more capable daily driver than the standard XS, but the large 6.5-inch OLED panel means screen repairs cost more. Whether repair makes sense depends on the type and number of issues present.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Battery replacement only</strong> — The most cost-effective repair for the XS Max. Restores daily battery life and removes performance throttling. The larger battery means users notice a more significant improvement after replacement compared to the standard XS.</li>
          <li><strong>Single-issue repairs</strong> — If only the screen or only the charging port needs attention and the rest of the device is in good condition, repair typically makes financial sense.</li>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Large OLED screen + back glass damage</strong> — The 6.5-inch OLED panel is one of the more expensive iPhone screens to replace. Combined with back glass repair, costs typically exceed the device's current market value.</li>
          <li><strong>Face ID failure after drops</strong> — The TrueDepth camera system is delicate. Repair often involves components that are expensive or difficult to source for this generation.</li>
          <li><strong>Multiple major repairs required</strong> — Screen, battery, and charging port failures together make repair uneconomical in most cases.</li>
          <li><strong>Repair cost approaches device value</strong> — As a general guideline, if the total repair estimate exceeds 50–60% of what a comparable replacement costs, upgrading is usually the better investment.</li>

      heading: "OLED Display Damage",
      contentHtml: `
        <p>The iPhone XS Max uses a 6.5-inch Super Retina OLED display — the largest screen Apple had produced at the time. When the screen cracks, the entire OLED panel and digitizer assembly must be replaced as one unit. The larger panel size makes this one of the costlier iPhone screen repairs.</p>
        <p>OLED damage can also present as colour distortion, green lines, or dead pixels even without visible cracks, typically after drops. These symptoms indicate panel damage that requires full replacement.</p>
        <p>Aftermarket OLED panels are available at lower price points than OEM, though colour accuracy and brightness may differ slightly. From our experience, most users find aftermarket OLED replacements acceptable for daily use.</p>

        <p>Like the <a href="/devices/iphone-xs">iPhone XS</a>, the XS Max features a stainless steel frame with back glass that is laser-welded to the housing. Back glass repair requires either a full housing swap or careful glass-only removal.</p>
        <p>The repair is viable and something we perform regularly, but it adds significant cost. For devices with back glass damage only, repair is usually worthwhile. For devices with both OLED screen and back glass damage, the combined cost frequently exceeds the device's market value — making a <a href="/trade-in">trade-in</a> the more practical path forward.</p>

      <p>The iPhone XS Max's trade-in value in 2026 is modest and heavily condition-dependent. The stainless steel frame helps preserve cosmetic condition, but battery health and screen condition remain the primary factors that determine value.</p>
      <p>Common upgrade paths from the iPhone XS Max include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>iPhone 12 — First iPhone with 5G, MagSafe, and a significantly longer iOS support window. A natural upgrade for XS Max users who want continued software support.</li>
        <li><a href="https://shop.mobiletechlab.ca/products/iphone-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Certified pre-owned iPhone 12</a> — Strong mid-range value for users buying used.</li>
        <li>iPhone 12 Pro Max or 13 Pro Max — For users who want to maintain the large-screen experience with modern camera and battery improvements.</li>
